# Sales Insights (Python & Power BI)

## Overview

This project analyzes synthetic data to provide insights, how products are selling across regions, time, and sales reps.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (via VS Code)
- **Power BI** (for interactive dashboarding)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and portfolio)

## Dataset Description

The dataset is fully synthetic and mimics a sales environment. Each row represents a sale and includes:

| Column     | Description                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ClientID   | Unique identifier for a client          |
| SalesRep   | Name of the sales representative        |
| Product    | Product type (Equity, Fixed income, etc.)       |
| Region     | Sales region (Europe, Asia, Americas)   |
| Quarter    | Time period (e.g. Q2-2024)              |
| Revenue    | Revenue from the sale (in USD)          |

## Visualizations & Insights

### 1. Revenue by Product Type
- Bar chart showing total revenue per investment product
- Insight: Identify which products generate the most revenue

### 2. Revenue Distribution by Region and Quarter
- Grouped bar chart with color-coded quarters
- Insight: Compare sales trends across regions and time

### 3. Sales Rep Performance
- Total revenue per sales representative
- Insight: Highlight top performers and underperformers

## Goals

- Practice full-cycle data analysis: data generation → cleaning → analysis → dashboard
- Build a portfolio project aligned with real-world asset management scenarios
- Demonstrate skills in Python, data visualization, and business storytelling
Note: Regarding cleaning - the negative revenues were removed and data types were verified.
Since the data was synthetic, no missing values were present.
This ensured the data was clean and ready for analysis.
